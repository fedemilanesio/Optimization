# Optimization
#Contrained Optimization problem, in which the user has to chose between minimize her "Cost" or "Time" duration of the one way travel to Rome. This a "trivial" example (considering that the program doesn't connect to any API to retrieve the nodes data) where a text file named 'Road.txt' is read by the program, which contains information about the initial, ending and intermediate nodes. Such info include the (non real-time) ticket cost to reach destinations and the timing employed by the means of transport to reach them.

#This project involves OOP and 'pulp library' to solve the optimization problem.
## THE ACTUAL FILE TO RUN IS ' ROAD_TO_ROMA.PY'.
